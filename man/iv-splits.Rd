\usage{
iv_splits(x, ..., on = NULL)

iv_identify_splits(x, ..., on = NULL)

iv_locate_splits(x, ..., on = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\verb{[iv]}

An interval vector.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{on}{\verb{[vector / NULL]}

An optional vector of additional values to split on.

This should have the same type as \code{iv_start(x)}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item For \code{iv_splits()}, an iv with the same type as \code{x}.
\item For \code{iv_identify_splits()}, a list-of containing ivs with the same size as
\code{x}.
\item For \code{iv_locate_splits()}, a two column data frame with a \code{key} column
of the same type as \code{x} and \code{loc} list-column containing integer vectors.
}
}
\description{
This family of functions revolves around splitting an iv on its endpoints,
which results in a new iv that is entirely disjoint (i.e. non-overlapping).
The intervals in the resulting iv are known as "splits".
\itemize{
\item \code{iv_splits()} computes the disjoint splits for \code{x}.
\item \code{iv_identify_splits()} identifies the splits that correspond to each
interval in \code{x}. It replaces \code{x} with a list of the same size where each
element of the list contains the splits that the corresponding interval in
\code{x} overlaps. This is particularly useful alongside \code{\link[tidyr:unnest]{tidyr::unnest()}}.
\item \code{iv_locate_splits()} returns a two column data frame with a \code{key} column
containing the result of \code{iv_splits()} and a \code{loc} list-column containing
integer vectors that map each interval in \code{x} to the splits that it overlaps.
